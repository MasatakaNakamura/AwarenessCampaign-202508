# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is an "Awareness Campaign" repository for promoting TypeScript adoption within a Japanese company. The project consists of:

- **LP原稿.md**: A Japanese markdown document containing the content for a TypeScript awareness campaign landing page, targeting Java engineers
- **index.html**: An empty HTML file (0 bytes) that appears to be a placeholder for the actual landing page

## Project Purpose

The repository contains materials for an internal TypeScript study session aimed at Java engineers. The content emphasizes:
- TypeScript's similarity to Java (static typing, classes, interfaces)
- Career advancement opportunities for Java developers learning TypeScript
- A study session led by team leader Koganemaru from the First System Division

## File Structure

```
/
├── LP原稿.md           # Campaign content in Japanese (TypeScript promotion material)
└── index.html          # Empty HTML file (placeholder)
```

## Development Notes

- This appears to be a documentation/content project rather than a software development project
- No build tools, package managers, or development frameworks are present
- The main content is in Japanese and focuses on TypeScript education for Java developers
- No test suite, linting, or build commands are available as this is primarily a content repository

## Content Details

The LP原稿.md file contains a complete awareness campaign document including:
- Introduction to TypeScript for Java engineers
- Benefits and learning path explanations
- Study session announcement details
- FAQ section addressing common concerns

Since this is a content-focused repository without traditional development tooling, most software engineering tasks would involve content editing rather than code compilation or testing.
